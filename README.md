# Welcome to My GitHub!

## Who am I?

My name is Jean and I'm 30 years old, I'm studying to become a full stack web developer. I've been a self-taught person since I was a child, but it wasn't until the end of 2022 that I decided to join the web development area. I have two Youtube channels, one focused on strategy games with 150k subscribers and a new one focused on my new journey as a programmer.

I'm currently studying about 8-10 hours a day on various subjects related to the area, I intend to dedicate myself to learning as much as possible.

## Topics I'm Studying

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Sass & Bootstrap  
- React & NativeReact  
- NodeJS  
- MongoDB & PostgreSQL
- TypeScript  
- Electron
- Many others

I already know a bit of Python and programming logic that I learned on my own a few years ago. But I intend to delve deeper into Python and maybe C# in the future.

## Places I'm studying

My current project is to make 20 landing pages for the Frontend Mentor website. You can access the project [here.](https://github.com/JeanArkantos/Frontend_Mentor_Project)
